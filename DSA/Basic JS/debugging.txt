1. console.log() is the best way to debug.

2. You can also debug in chrome using sources tab. Inside developer tools.

    open file and click on number to set a breakpoint. Whenever code gets to this section it will pause and we can hover and see the content. We can also see the scope and we can even console.

3. To write js code in chrome you can use console by pressing F12 or goto Sources in developer option and then inside that click on >> and then on Snippets. There you can create new js snippets and can run them.
